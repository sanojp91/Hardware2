## Description
The product we have designed is an embedded audio device that would hypothetically be connected to monitoring machines in a 
hospital’s intensive care unit. The device plays bird song and different colored lights so long as the machine is registering 
normal activity in the patient, but if anything changes or seems problematic,  the device reverts to playing the traditional 
alarm beep to alert hospital staff. 

We have prototyped this product by allowing for the samples to be changed back and forth using the board’s in-built buttons, 
to show how the switchover would work.  Both buttons within the prototype trigger a different ambient loop with bird song and 
relaxing colors, to show what type of output the device could potentially have. In addition to this, we have also implemented 
a switch that enables just soothing light to be outputted with no audio which still makes it visually clear that the patients’ 
status is normal but won’t add to the surrounding noises.
